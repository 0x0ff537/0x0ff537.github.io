      <description>Ethical hacker, musician, sound engineer, web developer and passionate about cybersecurity.
I have been interested in hacking since late 90’s. I have always felt curious about how hackers do what they do, that curiosity turned into a hobby and the hobby turned into a passion! My first approach to this magnificent world was reverse engineering some malware, and now a days I like to code it.
I’m also a junior full-stack web developer, this has helped me understand how things work behind the scenes in website hacking.</description>
